        <h2 class="main__title">AutoDraw: a fantastic website for drawing</h2>
        <p class="main__text">
          As you could read on the cover of this article, if your thing is not
          drawing, you can use this fantastic website to create drawings easily,
          all you need is to make a shape similar to the drawing you want, and
          the web will show you drawings that you reference, the page is very
          well done, the truth, and has several options and shortcuts that you
          can use.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          In addition, in the background image of the header I show you a
          graphic example of what can be achieved by simply drawing a stroke, in
          this case, I drew "a glass" and the page has detected it perfectly
          (keep in mind that this is an edited image, obviously the page is not
          like that), it even offered me other images, like a paint bucket. This
          is very useful (as I said before) for those thesis, degree projects or
          works that have to be done with drawings, they facilitate the
          objectives and increase our productivity, although, this tool can make
          the lazy ones to be lazier...
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Below you will be able to read a summary of how to make these
          drawings, it is that, it is simple to make them, I will try to make it
          as short as possible, since I recognize that a lot of text can bore
          you and make you leave the site or skip to the point that matters to
          you.
        </p>
        <h3 class="main__subtitle">Draw something</h3>
        <p class="main__text">
          When you go to their website by clicking here, you will see a very
          user-friendly UI, consisting of several options, which I will list
          (they will be ordered as they appear on the page) and tell you their
          function at the same time:
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/drawing.webp"
          alt="drawing a donut"
          class="main__media"
        />
        <ul class="main__text main__text--list">
          <li>Select: selects an element.</li>
          <li>
            AutoDraw: drawing a shape or an outline, it offers some drawings to
            which you have referred.
          </li>
          <li>Draw.</li>
          <li>Type: write text.</li>
          <li>Fill: fills the selected background with some color.</li>
          <li>Shape: insert shape.</li>
          <li>Color: stroke color.</li>
          <li>Zoom.</li>
          <li>Undo.</li>
          <li>Delete: erase some element.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="main__text">
          The star option is AutoDraw, maybe it is not entirely accurate or
          maybe it does not know sometimes what we are referring to, but it is
          certainly useful, all you have to do is to draw a line and see what
          options it offers you, if you open the image above this paragraph
          maybe you can see a line that says: "Do you mean:", because that is
          what you are referring to. As an example, I drew a donut shape, it
          detected it and I applied their drawing, now, let's change the colors.
        </p>
        <h3 class="main__subtitle">Change the stroke color</h3>
        <p class="main__text">
          Note that when you set another stroke color, it is not applied to the
          current drawing you have on the screen, it will be applied through the
          next stroke you make, so I will make the outline again (I will not
          insert an image to avoid making this longer) and apply the reference
          they provide. You will see that in the next image:
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/ddraw-a-donut.webp"
          alt="changing the stroke color"
          class="main__media"
        />
        <p class="main__text">
          Once done again, I will proceed to fill the backgrounds with colors,
          imagine you are using Microsoft Paint or similar and you are going to
          fill in the blanks with colors.
        </p>
        <h3 class="main__subtitle">Fill the image</h3>
        <p class="main__text">
          Let's put first in context, the colors that I will use, for the bottom
          of the donut cake, I will use an orange that does not make much
          contrast, which will have as syrup a flavor that I love, chocolate,
          and background, a red color. While doing this, I found something that
          could be improved, and that is that the hole of the donut could be
          left in the color of the syrup or cake, but when trying to fill it,
          the bottom is colored, this is something more personal. You can see
          the result in the image below.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/colored-donut.webp"
          alt="Colored Donut"
          class="main__media"
        />
        <h3 class="main__subtitle">How to Download?</h3>
        <p class="main__text">
          You only have to click on the icon of the bars in the upper left
          corner, there you will see the option "Download", although it would be
          nice if there was a Pro version to access other functions, such as
          downloading the image without background and that you could change the
          stroke color of the image once the AutoDraw effect is applied, without
          more to say, below you have a video, and by the way, I hope you liked
          this post and share it with friends.
