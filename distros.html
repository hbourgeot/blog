          "my PC can not run that because it has 2gb of ram" or "my PC is too
          old", no offense, I say the above because I before trying Linux for
          the first time spoke badly of this, and when I first used Ubuntu, left
          a good taste in my mouth.

              Let's start with the most recommended distro for users who want to
              get into Linux, it is highly recommended because it does not
              require advanced configurations (I approve this), I lasted about 8
              months using Ubuntu and I had no errors, of course, I did not
              touch things I should not have done. In Ubuntu you can have many
              desktop environments, but by default comes Gnome, the minimum RAM
              requirement is 2gb, but it is recommended to have more than 4gb
              because with four is somewhat short, it happened to me a lot when
              using VS Code, Telegram, and three tabs (WhatsApp, Udemy and the
              local host) of Google Chrome.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3 class="ubuntu__subtitle">What are the Ubuntu requirements?</h3>
          <p class="main__text">
            To install and use Ubuntu, your PC requires the following:
          </p>
          <ul class="main__text main__text--list">
            <li>Memory RAM: 2gb minimum (4gb recommended)</li>
            <li>
              Processor architecture: 64 bits, I must mention that the processor
              architecture is NOT defined by the operating system architecture,
              check the processor by looking for the model of your PC.
            </li>
            <li>2 GHz dual core processor or better</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="main__text">
            As you can see, Ubuntu is not so exquisite in terms of hardware
            requirements, as I said before, by clicking on the headers you will
            go to the official pages of each distro, below you will see a
            screenshot of the default appearance of Ubuntu with Gnome

              There is not much to say about Xubuntu, as its name suggests, it
              is based on Ubuntu, the difference here is that Xubuntu does not
              have Gnome as desktop environment, it has XFCE, hence the X in its
              name, the appearance can be a bit old-fashioned, but with certain
              customizations (it is very easy to customize Linux, easier than in
              Windows, plus you do not have many restrictions) you can give it a
              more modern view.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p class="main__text">
            The advantage of using Xubuntu is that computers with 1gb of RAM can
            use it, it is not recommended, but that is the minimum to be able to
            use it, I'm sure you wonder why it is not recommended? xubuntu uses
            700mb of RAM by default without anything open, if you open Chrome,
            you would crash your PC, so it would be better to have at least 2gb.

          <ul class="main__text main__text--list">
            <li>
              Memory RAM: The official xubuntu site mentions that the PC must
              have at least 512mb of RAM (I recommend to have at least 1gb), and
              they recommend to have 2gb of RAM for a good performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Free space on hard disk: they mentions at least 8gb free, but
              recommend 20gb free.

            better, since both fulfill their function: to satisfy the needs of
            low-end or old PCs, Lubuntu currently has LXQT as desktop
            environment, which is also characterized by being lightweight. Below

              PCs of all ranges, since When you download this they give you a
              choice of three desktop environments: Cinnamon, the one they made
              especially for LM (I'm going to refer to Linux Mint that way),
              Mate or XFCE.

            leave this section so empty, I leave you some distros that are
            derived from arch, if you want to install any of them it is with
            your own consent.

              If you love MacOS but you can't use it because you don't have a
              mac and you don't have enough money to buy one, pearOS is an
              excellent alternative, in its website that you can access by
              clicking on the header, the design of this is practically a copy
              of macOS made with great affection by its creators, who try to
              resemble their OS as much as possible with the bitten apple's one.

            Although in any Linux distro with great customizations you can give
            it a macOS-like look, if you don't have much time to customize your
            OS, then this is perfect for you, however, I recommend that you
            install one of the other distros, as it is believed that one has
            been discontinued and there are not many reviews on the internet, so
            be careful... below you can see a screenshot of its latest version.
