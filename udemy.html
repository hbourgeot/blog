        <h2 class="main__title">Where I can find Udemy Coupons?</h2>
        <p class="main__text">
          All over the internet you can find many sites that collect the coupons
          that have come out and show them on their website or Telegram channel,
          however as we all know, not everything is as it appears to be and some
          sites can hide trojans or have backdoors on their websites to infect
          your PC, for that reason, I will tell you about some sites and safe
          Telegram channels, where you will not have to be suspicious.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          So, let's go step by step through the sites I will show you, keep in
          mind that some sites are in Spanish, you can translate them, as they
          also offer coupons for courses in English, 75% of the coupons on some
          sites are in English.
        </p>
        <h3 class="main__subtitle">
          CursosDev: more than just courses for devs.
        </h3>
        <img
          src="images/cursosdev.webp"
          alt="CursosDev webpage"
          class="main__img"
        />
        <p class="main__text">
          On this website you can find many coupons, almost anything you want,
          but you must make sure that it has not expired (as it is expected from
          a coupon), here you can find courses from building a PC to
          cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Now, how do I access the coupons to
          "buy" courses? You can access the coupons section by selecting the 4th
          option, then, click on the course you want to obtain.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Once on the page of the course you want, you can see next to the name
          and cover of the course how much time is left on the coupon, and
          below, there are three buttons, one on the left to see more courses,
          another on the right to report the expiration of the coupon, and
          finally the one that matters to us is centered, which says "Get
          coupon", you click on it for redirect to the Udemy page, where you can
          continue following the clear steps that Udemy tells you to get the
          course.

        <h3 class="main__subtitle">Facialix: Udemy coupons and more!</h3>
        <p class="main__text">
          On facialix, you can find much more than coupons for Udemy, you can
          also find free courses from other learning platforms, such as edX and
          Coursera, however, this blog does not only offer courses, it also
          provides several free books, which are interesting to say the truth,
          although it also provides tutorials that are related to programming.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Something that has surprised me, is that they have a service called
          EducaLix, you can select which courses to see and things like that, I
          would love to tell you more about it, but I don't have enough
          information (besides that I don't have much confidence in them).
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/facialix.webp"
          alt="Facialix website"
          class="main__img"
        />
        <p class="main__text">
          About the courses, the process to use the coupons is very similar to
          the website we saw before, only that in the lower area of the course
          page you will find only two buttons (before continuing, you should
          know that they also offer free Udemy courses, not only coupons), the
          one on the left, is the one that will take us to the Udemy page with
          the coupon, it should say "Go to Course", and the button located on
          the right is one that leads to the Facialix Telegram channel.

          Telegram channels: more than one channel for redeem coupons
        </h3>
        <p class="main__text">
          There are more channels in Telegram than I think to redeem coupons,
          seriously, there are too many, this is because there are for each
          language, at least that I have been aware of in Spanish there are four
          channels, but two of these also show you which coupons are in English,
          this is usable if you want to be bilingual.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          To search for channels, just go to the search field and enter "Udemy
          Coupons" and the channels or groups that match the search term will be
          displayed, as you can see in the image below, note that I searched in
          Spanish, so the result may vary.
        </p>
        <img src="images/udemy.webp" alt="" class="main__img" />
        <p class="main__text">
          Keep in mind that some channels can take you to malicious sites, be
          careful with what you find. As a personal advice, buy the courses, do
          not use coupons, I have more than 20 courses that I have redeemed with
          coupons and I do not feel the pressure to finish them since I took
          them practically for free, instead when paying, you feel more pressure
          because you spend your money. And do not get carried away with the
          free courses you find, not all are good.
